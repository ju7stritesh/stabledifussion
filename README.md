### StableDiffusion pipeline to generate images from text

A text-to-image model is a machine learning model which takes an input natural language description and produces an image matching that description.
 OpenAI's DALL-E 2, Google Brain's Imagen, StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are the top 4 players in this area,
stablediffusion being the only one available readily for open source developers.

Text-to-image models generally combine a language model, which transforms the input text into a latent representation, and a generative image model, which produces an image conditioned on that representation. The most effective models have generally been trained on massive amounts of image and text data scraped from the web.
